I've created a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with the following features:

1. User Management:

- View, add, edit, and delete users
- Assign roles to users
- Track user status (Active/Inactive)
- Clean and intuitive user interface


2. Role Management:

- Create and manage roles with descriptions
- Assign multiple permissions to roles
- Visual permission management interface
- Easy-to-use role editing system


3. Permission System:

- Predefined set of permissions (read, write, delete, admin)
- Visual permission assignment interface
- Clear permission indicators for each role


4. Mock Data & State Management:

- Used Zustand for state management
- Implemented mock data for users, roles, and permissions
- Simulated API operations through state management



5. UI/UX Features:

- Clean, modern interface using Tailwind CSS
- Responsive design
- Intuitive navigation between users and roles
- Clear visual feedback for actions
- Icons from Lucide React for better visual hierarchy


The application is now running and you can:

- Switch between Users and Roles tabs
- Add, edit, and delete users
- Create and modify roles with specific permissions
- View all users and their assigned roles
- Manage permissions for each role
  
The code is organized into small, focused components and follows best practices for maintainability and scalability.
